Programming paradigms in ruby

#matrix.rb
This is a program doing basic operations on matrixes such as sum multiplication and transposition.

#printMatrix(matrix)
printMatrix is a basic function that takes a matrix as an argument and display it visualy structured as a matix

#matrixSum(matrixA, matrixB)
matrixSum is a function that that takes two matixes as arguments and returns new matrix that is a sum of two given arguments.
In order to sum two matrixes they have to be of the same size - number of rows and columns has to be the same, this function checks this condition and if matrixes comply with this requirement sum operation is carried out, otherwise information about this requirement is displayed.

#multiplyMatrix(matrix1, matrix2)
multiplyMatrix is a funtion that takes two matixes as arguments and returns new matrix that is a multiplication of two given arguments. Matrix derived from multiplication of two matrixes has the same number of columns as matrix1 and number of rows as matrix2. 
In order to multiply two matrixes they have to have number of rows  coresponding number of columns , this function checks this condition and if matrixes comply with this requirement multiplication operation is carried out, otherwise information about this requirement is displayed.

#transposeMatrix(matrix1)
transposeMatrix function takes one matrix as na argument and returns new matrix that has rows exchanged with columns in relation to matrix given as an argument.
